Big Data -> Big Ding Dong (Chrome)
=============

The phrase big data has been twisted, warped, and coaxed into meaning almost anything. What's one more loaded meaning?

This Google Chrome extension replaces occurrences of 'big data' on web pages with 'big ding dong'.

This extension is a modification of Steven Frank's work on [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt), an extension which works nicely alongside this one.
